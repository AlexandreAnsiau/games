# SCRABBLE

This application aims to give to the player all the possible words he can make with the letter she/he gets.
That means that words which contain letters that the player does not receive will not appear in the list of the possibilities.

## How execute script
The easiest way to test this application is to work inside the 'exec.py' file. The ScrabbleSet class is made to generate the 
list of possible words. You can enter arguments in this class and then execute the script in your terminal. In this one you 
must stop at the scrabble directory. And then you can run the command:  

```
python exec
```
